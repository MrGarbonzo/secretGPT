# Attest AI Interface Improvements - Living Document

## 🎯 TOP PRIORITY: Complete Circle of Attestation / Chain of Proof

### Two-Pronged Strategy

#### Path 1: Standalone Technical Deep-Dive Page
**Target Audience**: Security professionals, auditors, developers, compliance teams

**Features**:
- **Live Attestation Data Integration**: Pull real attestation data from existing endpoints
- **Technical Proof Visualization**: Use actual MRTD, RTMR values as working examples
- **Deep Technical Explanations**: Intel TDX specifics, cryptographic details, hash chains
- **Verifiable Claims**: Every statement backed by actual data and citations
- **Expert-Level Documentation**: Complete technical specifications and references

#### Path 2: Integrated Medium-Technical Explainers
**Target Audience**: Informed users, business stakeholders, technical-adjacent roles

**Integration Points**:
- **Chat Interface**: Add "How This Works" sections with drill-down explanations
- **Attestation Page**: Expand existing cards with contextual "Why This Matters" info
- **Infrastructure Transparency**: Show Docker images, GitHub links, deployment details
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, allow drilling down for more detail

### Core Vision
Create a comprehensive understanding pathway where users can start with accessible explanations and drill down to any level of technical detail they need, while always being able to verify claims with real, live data.

### Key Components to Visualize

#### 1. Hardware Root of Trust
- **Intel TDX/AMD SEV Foundation**: Show how the CPU itself provides the initial trust anchor
- **Secure Boot Process**: Visualize how the TEE environment is established
- **Hardware Measurements**: Display how the initial state is cryptographically measured

#### 2. VM Bootstrap Chain
- **Bootloader Attestation**: Show how the VM starts with verified components
- **OS Kernel Verification**: Display kernel measurements and signatures
- **Application Loading**: Demonstrate how Attest AI and Secret AI are loaded and measured

#### 3. Runtime Verification
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Show how RTMR values track runtime integrity
- **Memory Protection**: Visualize how data remains encrypted and isolated
- **Inter-VM Communication**: Display how the two VMs securely communicate

#### 4. User Interaction Chain
- **Message Journey**: Trace a user message from input to AI processing to response
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Show where signatures and attestations are generated
- **Verification Points**: Highlight where users can independently verify each step

### Implementation Details

#### Path 1: Technical Deep-Dive Page (`/technical-attestation`)

**Live Data Integration**:
```
- Pull real MRTD/RTMR values from /api/v1/attestation/self
- Show actual Docker image hashes from docker-compose.yml
- Display GitHub commit SHAs for running code
- Real-time infrastructure status from deployment
```

**Technical Chain Visualization**:
```
[Hardware Root] → [Secure Boot] → [Docker Image] → [Attest AI VM] → [Secret AI VM] → [User Proof]
       ↓               ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
   [CPU TEE]      [Measured Boot]  [Image Hash]   [MRTD/RTMR]   [Dual Attest]  [Crypto Proof]
   Intel TDX      UEFI/GRUB       SHA256:abc...   d1b2c3...     Verified ✓     Timestamped
```

**Infrastructure Transparency**:
- **GitHub Links**: Direct links to exact commit running in production
- **Docker Registry**: Show image tags and digests being used
- **Deployment Config**: Live docker-compose.yml with annotations
- **Verification Tools**: Scripts users can run to verify independently

#### Path 2: Integrated Explainers

**Chat Interface Enhancements**:
- **"Trust This Message" button**: Expands to show attestation chain for that specific interaction
- **Infrastructure Panel**: Collapsible sidebar showing "What's Running"
  - Docker image: `attestai/chat-interface:v2.1.0`
  - GitHub: `github.com/user/repo/commit/abc123` 
  - Last verified: `2 minutes ago ✓`

**Attestation Page Drill-Downs**:
- **MRTD Explainer**: "This hash proves the VM started with unmodified code" → [Learn More]
- **RTMR Details**: "These values change if anything is tampered with" → [Technical Details]
- **Certificate Chain**: Visual path from Intel root → Your VM → This attestation

**Progressive Disclosure Examples**:
```
Level 1: "This VM is verified ✓"
Level 2: "Verified by Intel hardware security at 2:34 PM"
Level 3: "MRTD: d1b2c3... proves boot integrity, RTMR0: a1b2c3... shows runtime state"
Level 4: [Link to technical deep-dive page]

## 💡 Research & Questions

### Technical Research Needed

#### Live Infrastructure Data Extraction Approaches

**Current Data Availability:**
- **Secret AI VM**: Limited attestation data available now, more coming next week
- **SecretGPT VM**: Full data access (same VM running this UI) - our primary source
- **Phase 1 Focus**: Extract what we can from SecretGPT VM, prepare for Secret AI expansion

**Docker Image Digests & GitHub SHAs - Phase 1 Implementation:**

**Approach 1: Parse Deployment Files (Starting Point)**
```yaml
# From docker-compose.yml (SecretGPT VM)
services:
  attest-ai:
    image: attestai/chat-interface:v2.1.0@sha256:abc123def456...
    labels:
      - "git.commit=abc123def456789"
      - "git.repo=https://github.com/MrGarbonzo/secretGPT"
      - "git.branch=attest_ai"
```

**Approach 2: Runtime Container Inspection (SecretGPT VM)**
```bash
# Get running container digest (local access)
docker inspect $(docker ps -q) | jq '.[0].Image'
# Get labels with git info
docker inspect $(docker ps -q) | jq '.[0].Config.Labels'
```

**Implementation Priority:**
- **Week 1**: SecretGPT VM data extraction (docker-compose + inspect)
- **Week 2**: Prepare Secret AI VM integration endpoints
- **Week 3**: Full dual-VM data display once Secret AI data available

#### Progressive Disclosure Depth Guidelines

**3-Level System (Starting Implementation):**

**Example: MRTD Explanation (30-40 year old audience)**
```
Level 1: "VM integrity verified ✓" 
Level 2: "Like a tamper-evident seal - proves nothing was modified since startup"
Level 3: "MRTD hash d1b2c3... is your VM's unique fingerprint from secure boot"
```

**Example: Docker Image Trust**
```
Level 1: "Running verified code ✓"
Level 2: "Like checking the software version and publisher before installing"
Level 3: "Image: attestai/chat-interface:v2.1.0 built from GitHub commit def456..."
```

**Example: Dual VM Security**
```
Level 1: "AI processing isolated ✓"
Level 2: "Like having your conversation in a soundproof room with a trusted translator"
Level 3: "Secret AI runs in separate VM with independent attestation verification"
```

**Analogy Guidelines for 30-40 Year Olds:**
- **Banking/Finance**: "Like checking account verification", "secure vault", "notarized documents"
- **Real Estate**: "Title insurance", "property inspection", "escrow account"
- **Automotive**: "CarFax report", "certified pre-owned", "warranty verification"
- **Professional**: "Background check", "professional certification", "audit trail"
- **Technology**: "Software updates", "antivirus scans", "two-factor authentication"

#### Independent Verification Tools (Future Phase)

**Priority Order for Later Implementation:**
1. **Docker Image Verification Script**: Compare running digest with registry
2. **GitHub Commit Verification**: Verify container was built from claimed commit
3. **Attestation Chain Validator**: Verify complete trust chain
4. **Proof File Auditor**: Independent conversation proof verification
5. **Continuous Monitoring Tools**: Real-time attestation health checks

**Starting Focus: Explainers Only**
- Build the progressive disclosure UI framework
- Create contextual explanations for existing attestation data
- Design drill-down interaction patterns
- Test with different user personas

### User Research Questions
- What level of technical detail do users want?
- How important is real-time vs. on-demand verification?
- What analogies work best for explaining TEE concepts?
- What proof formats are most useful for different use cases?

### Competitive Analysis
- How do other attestation systems present trust information?
- What are the current best practices in security visualization?
- What compliance requirements should we consider?
- How do enterprise users typically consume attestation data?
