### Integration Patterns
- **[integration/](./integration/)** - How to integrate MCP with secretGPT's hub architecture

### Secret Network Integration
- **[secret-network/](./secret-network/)** - Blockchain-specific MCP tools and patterns

### Security & Best Practices
- **[security/](./security/)** - Security considerations for MCP in TEE environments

### Implementation Guides
- **[implementation/](./implementation/)** - Practical development guidance

### Transport & Communication
- **[transport/](./transport/)** - Message transport mechanisms and patterns

### Ecosystem & Examples
- **[ecosystem/](./ecosystem/)** - Available servers, tools, and implementation examples

## üéØ Quick Reference

### Key MCP Concepts
- **MCP is like "USB-C for AI"** - standardizes how applications connect to data sources and tools
- **Client-Server Architecture** - secretGPT acts as MCP client, connects to MCP servers
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 Messaging** - all communication uses standard JSON-RPC protocol
- **Three Primitives**: Resources (data), Tools (actions), Prompts (templates)

### Integration with secretGPT
- MCP integrates as a new service component in the hub router
- Follows same patterns as existing Secret AI service integration
- Maintains TEE attestation guarantees for all MCP operations
- Supports both AttestAI testing and future secretGPT frontend

### Security Model
- **User Consent**: All MCP operations require explicit user approval
- **TEE Integration**: MCP tool execution included in attestation proofs
- **Input Validation**: All tool parameters validated against JSON schemas
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions for different tool categories

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic MCP Integration
1. Add MCP service to hub router (`ComponentType.MCP_SERVICE`)
2. Implement basic tool discovery and execution
3. Test with simple tools (file system, basic APIs)
4. Validate attestation inclusion

### Phase 2: Secret Network Tools
1. Develop Secret Network query tools
2. Implement transaction submission tools
3. Add governance and staking tools
4. Optimize for blockchain performance

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Tool chaining and composition
2. Resource subscriptions and real-time updates
3. Prompt template system
4. Sampling integration (when supported)

## üìñ Documentation Sources

This reference library is based on:
- **Official MCP Documentation**: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/
- **MCP Specification**: https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/
- **Protocol Revision**: 2024-11-05 (current as of documentation creation)
- **TypeScript Schema**: Source of truth for all protocol messages

## üîó Related secretGPT Documentation

- **[../secretAI/](../secretAI/)** - Secret AI SDK integration patterns
- **[../attest_data/](../attest_data/)** - Attestation reference data
- **[../scripts/](../scripts/)** - Environment setup and validation scripts

## üìù Notes for Developers

- **Start with AttestAI**: Use existing web UI for MCP testing and validation
- **Follow Hub Patterns**: MCP integration should mirror Secret AI service patterns
- **Maintain Security**: All MCP operations must preserve TEE guarantees
- **Document Everything**: Track which tools work, performance characteristics, security implications
