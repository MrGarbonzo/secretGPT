# attest_tool Research Summary

## 🎯 **Research Strategy**

You have a well-structured experimental environment set up to carefully research the Secret Labs `attest_tool` before integrating it into your production secretGPT system.

### **✅ What's Ready**

1. **Isolated Research Environment**
   - `F:\coding\secretGPT\experiments\attest_tool_research\`
   - Completely separate from production code
   - Structured directories for organized research

2. **Sample Data Prepared**
   - Your actual production attestation quote copied
   - Test variations (truncated, invalid, empty)
   - Data manifest with metadata

3. **Analysis Tools Created**
   - `quote_analyzer.py` - Comprehensive attest_tool interface testing
   - `current_parser.py` - Baseline comparison with your hardcoded parsing
   - `kickoff.py` - Guided setup and initial testing

4. **Research Methodology**
   - Phased approach from basic execution to integration
   - Comprehensive testing matrix
   - Performance benchmarking plan

### **🚀 Getting Started**

**Step 1: Run the Kickoff Script**
```bash
cd F:\coding\secretGPT\experiments\attest_tool_research
python kickoff.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Verify your environment setup
- 📥 Clone the secret-vm-ops repository  
- 🔍 Search for attest_tool binaries
- 🧪 Test your current parser baseline
- 📋 Guide you through next steps

**Step 2: Tool Acquisition** 

The kickoff script will attempt to:
1. Clone `https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret-vm-ops.git`
2. Search for `attest_tool` binaries or source code
3. Copy any found tools to your `tools/` directory

**Step 3: Interface Analysis**

Once you have `attest_tool`:
```bash
python tools/quote_analyzer.py
```

This will comprehensively test:
- Command-line arguments and help
- Input format options
- Output format variations
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance characteristics

### **🔍 Research Focus Areas**

1. **Interface Documentation**
   - What arguments does `attest_tool` accept?
   - What input formats does it support?
   - What output formats are available?

2. **Output Structure Analysis**
   - Does it output JSON with structured fields?
   - How do the field names map to your current `mrtd`, `rtmr0`, etc?
   - Are the extracted values identical to your hardcoded parsing?

3. **Error Handling**
   - How does it handle malformed quotes?
   - What error codes and messages does it return?
   - Is it robust enough for production use?

4. **Performance & Integration**
   - How fast is execution compared to your current parsing?
   - Can it handle concurrent executions?
   - What's the best subprocess integration pattern?

### **🎛️ Fallback Plans**

**If attest_tool isn't found in secret-vm-ops:**

1. **Check secret-vm-attest-rest-server**: The secret-vm-attest-rest-server executes an internal process (e.g., attest_tool) and returns a JSON attestation report
   - Clone: `https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret-vm-attest-rest-server.git`  
   - Look for the tool it calls internally

2. **Contact Secret Labs**: Ask about `attest_tool` availability or documentation

3. **Intel DCAP Route**: Fall back to your original Intel DCAP integration plan

4. **REST Server Integration**: Use the secret-vm-attest-rest-server as a service

### **🏗️ Integration Planning**

Based on research findings, you'll design:

1. **Python Wrapper** (`integration_tests/subprocess_wrapper.py`)
   - Async subprocess execution
   - Error handling and timeouts
   - Input/output format handling

2. **Enhanced Attestation Service** (`prototype/enhanced_attestation_service.py`)
   - Drop-in replacement for current parsing
   - Fallback to hardcoded parsing if tool fails
   - Caching and performance optimization

3. **Test Integration** (`prototype/test_integration.py`)
   - Validate with your existing attestation flow
   - Compare results with current implementation
   - Performance benchmarking

### **📊 Success Criteria**

✅ **Tool Understanding**: Complete interface documentation  
✅ **Output Validation**: Verified accuracy vs current parsing  
✅ **Integration Design**: Working Python wrapper with error handling  
✅ **Performance Baseline**: Acceptable execution time  
✅ **Production Readiness**: Robust error handling and fallback  

### **⚠️ Safety Measures**

- **No production changes** until research is complete
- **Isolated testing** in experimental directory
- **Baseline preservation** of current parsing logic
- **Gradual integration** with feature flags when ready

## 🎬 **Next Action**

Run the kickoff script to begin:

```bash
cd F:\coding\secretGPT\experiments\attest_tool_research
python kickoff.py
```

This will guide you through the entire setup process and help you locate and test the `attest_tool`. Once you have findings from this research, we can design the optimal integration strategy for your production secretGPT system.

The experimental setup gives you a safe, structured way to thoroughly understand the tool before making any changes to your working system.
